# Predicting Likelyhood of Heart Disease
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for 31% of all deaths worldwide with four out of five CVD deaths attributed to heart attack or stroke. Patients who are known to have CVD or who are considered to be at higher risk due to preexisting factors including but not limited to diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or hypertension would benefit from an early detection system for heart failure. A dataset merging five large scale studies has been created identifying 11 common features associated with CVD. The goal of this project is to build and train a predictive model for identifying patients with an increased risk of heart failure. This model once implemented will be used to identify patients with the probability of being at a higher risk of heart failure based on known/observable information.
